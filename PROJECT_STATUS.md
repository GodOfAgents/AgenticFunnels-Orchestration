**Impact:** Cannot compile frontend  
**Workaround:** Deploy to environment with Wasp installed  
**Solution:** Use Wasp-compatible hosting (Fly.io, Railway)

### Issue 2: Mock Data in Services
**Impact:** Data not persisted  
**Workaround:** Test with API calls (returns mock data)  
**Solution:** Implement database queries (2-3 hours work)

### Issue 3: Docker Not Available
**Impact:** Milvus & Redis not running  
**Workaround:** RAG features will be limited  
**Solution:** Deploy to environment with Docker
