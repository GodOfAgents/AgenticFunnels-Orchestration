## 🐛 Known Issues & Resolutions

### ✅ RESOLVED Issues

#### Issue 1: Wasp Framework Dependencies
**Impact:** Frontend couldn't build due to Wasp-specific imports  
**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Migrated to React + Vite, removed all Wasp dependencies  
**Date Resolved:** October 2025

#### Issue 2: PostCSS Configuration Error
**Impact:** Tailwind CSS not processing correctly  
**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Added autoprefixer to package.json and updated config  
**Date Resolved:** October 2025

#### Issue 3: process.env Not Defined in Vite
**Impact:** Environment variables not accessible in frontend  
**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Added define config in vite.config.ts  
**Date Resolved:** October 2025

#### Issue 4: FastAPI Route Matching Issues
**Impact:** Workflow endpoints conflicting (/:id matching before /templates)  
**Resolution:** ✅ RESOLVED - Reordered routes in workflows.py API router  
**Date Resolved:** October 2025

### ⚠️ ACTIVE Issues (Low Priority)

#### Issue 1: Milvus Vector DB Not Running
**Impact:** RAG features limited without vector storage  
**Workaround:** Document uploads accepted, processing deferred  
**Solution:** Setup Milvus with Docker or cloud service  
**Priority:** Medium (needed for full RAG)

#### Issue 2: Some Services Use Mock Data
**Impact:** Data may not persist across restarts  
**Workaround:** Most operations use MongoDB, some edge cases may use mocks  
**Solution:** Audit all service files, ensure MongoDB usage  
**Priority:** Medium

#### Issue 3: Authentication Not Fully Implemented
**Impact:** No user isolation, anyone can access any agent  
**Workaround:** Assume single-tenant usage for now  
**Solution:** Complete JWT implementation with user session management  
**Priority:** High (for production)
