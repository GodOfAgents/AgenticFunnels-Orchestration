## üéØ What is AFO? The Future of Customer Engagement is Autonomous

**AFO (Agentic Funnel Orchestration)** is a comprehensive, self-hosted, and multi-tenant platform designed to automate your entire customer engagement funnel‚Äîfrom lead qualification to 24/7 support‚Äîusing intelligent, multimodal AI agents.

Built for **Sales Managers, Support Leads, and Operations Directors**, AFO transforms manual, expensive, and slow customer interactions into a high-speed, cost-effective, and always-on revenue engine.

### üí° The Problem We Solve

| The Old Way (Pain Points) | The AFO Solution (The Trigger/Hook) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Manual** customer engagement is time-consuming and expensive. | **Autonomous Agents** handle lead qualification, scheduling, and support 24/7. |
| **Traditional chatbots** lack intelligence, context, and can't handle complex workflows. | **Intelligent Workflows** built with a visual, no-code builder for complex, multi-step conversations. |
| **Third-party AI services** are costly, have high latency, and lead to vendor lock-in. | **Self-Hosted & Cost-Effective.** Deploy on your own infrastructure for **85% lower cost** and complete data control. |
| **Integration complexity** requires technical expertise and creates data silos. | **17+ Pre-built Integrations** (CRM, Calendar, Email) connect your entire tech stack seamlessly. |
