The AI engineer successfully initiated the Agentic Funnel Orchestration (AFO) platform build, focusing on a multi-tenant SaaS model. The initial phase established the backend with FastAPI, MongoDB, Milvus, and Redis, creating a robust service structure including agents, conversations, knowledge, integrations, and admin modules. Prisma schema was updated for data models. Frontend Wasp routes and placeholder React components were generated. Critical fixes addressed configuration loading issues in FastAPI, leading to successful backend service startup and endpoint testing. ElevenLabs TTS integration was partially added. Phase 2 commenced with Deepgram and Pipecat integration, establishing voice session and workflow services, and updating agent schemas for API keys. The work currently focuses on updating frontend components for Phase 2 features. Key challenges included Docker unavailability, Wasp CLI not being installed in the environment, and  configuration issues.

<product_requirements>
The Agentic Funnel Orchestration (AFO) platform is a multi-tenant SaaS for B2B companies, sales teams, and service-based businesses to deploy AI agents for customer engagement via voice and text, automating lead qualification, scheduling, and support.

**Key Features:** Multimodal communication (text/voice via Pipecat), Agent Persona Configuration, RAG-powered Knowledge Base integration (Milvus, RAG-Anything), Workflow Execution (external APIs), and various Deployment Options (embed code, webhook, API).

**Onboarding/Configuration:** User sign-up (Open-SaaS), multi-step agent creation (Name, Role, Persona), Knowledge Base allocation (document upload), API Connection Manager (secure vault for user-provided API keys like Twilio, CRM, Calendar, Deepgram, ElevenLabs), UI template selection, and deployment code generation.

**Dashboard:** Live Agent Status, Analytics, Monitoring Console, Conversation/Call history, Knowledge Base management, and Natural Language Workflow Customization (no-code).

**Integrations (MLP):** Twilio (voice/SMS), WebRTC, Google Calendar, Calendly, and 3 popular CRMs.

**User Journey (Lead Qualification & Scheduling):** Agent loads via embed code, recognizes intent (information/scheduling), provides RAG-powered info or collects lead data to schedule via Calendar/CRM, followed by automated reminders (Twilio/Email).

**Admin Panel:** Tiered admin access, real-time monitoring (WebSocket), anomaly detection, using existing Wasp UI.

**Changes Summary:**
-   : Modified to include new models for AFO (e.g., Agent, Conversation, Message, KnowledgeBase, Integration, Workflow, Anomaly).
-   : New directory created for the FastAPI backend.
    -   : Populated with Python dependencies, including , , .
    -   : Created to store backend environment variables, including .
    -   : Modified repeatedly to fix  loading issues, eventually switching to a dataclass and manual  loading.
    -   : Updated to register new API routers (, , , , , , , ).
    -   New directories for , ,  with numerous files: This creates the modular structure for different AFO features.
    -   : Generated to document the backend endpoints.
-   : Created for Milvus and Redis services (though Docker is not available in the environment).
-   : Modified to add new frontend routes and pages for AFO features (e.g., , , , ).
-   : New directory with sub-directories for React components (e.g., , , , , , , , ).
    -   , : Created for frontend-backend communication.
    -   Various  files (e.g., , , ): These are placeholder React components for the AFO UI.
-   , , : New documentation files created.

<pending_tasks>
- End-to-end testing of Phase 1 (backend and frontend integration).
- Full implementation of Deepgram and Pipecat for real-time voice (STT/TTS).
- Integrating user-provided API keys for Twilio, Calendar, CRM.
- Building out the actual UI components for Phase 2 workflows and voice interfaces.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in implementing **Phase 2: Voice + Workflows** for the AFO platform. This involves integrating Deepgram for Speech-to-Text and  for workflow orchestration.

On the backend (), the following has been completed:
-   Installation of  (v4.7.0) and  (v0.0.91).
-   Creation of new service files:
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
-   Creation of new API endpoint files:
    -   
    -   
-   Updating  to include the new  and  API routers.
-   Updating the agent schema () to include fields for Deepgram and ElevenLabs API keys, aligning with the user's multi-tenant bring your own API requirement for voice agents.

The backend service was successfully restarted, and initial health checks and existing API endpoints were verified, indicating the new Phase 2 backend structure is available, despite some Pipecat deprecation warnings.

On the frontend (), the work immediately preceding this summary was:
-   Updating existing frontend components (, ) to prepare for Phase 2 features. The specific contents of these updates were not fully detailed in the trajectory, but indicated structural or styling adjustments for the upcoming features.
-   The next explicit step mentioned was Now let me create new frontend components for workflows and voice interface, which directly follows the component updates.
