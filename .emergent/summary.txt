The AI engineer successfully built out significant portions of the Agentic Funnel Orchestration (AFO) platform. Initially, Phase 1 focused on backend services (FastAPI, MongoDB, Milvus, Redis) and Wasp/React frontend placeholders, addressing configuration issues and adding ElevenLabs. Phase 2 commenced with Deepgram/Pipecat integration for voice and workflows. Key developments included a major migration from Daily.co to LiveKit for WebRTC at user request, and a full shift from Deepgram to Qwen 3 Omni for multimodal AI, impacting backend services and API endpoints. The frontend saw updates to landing pages, authentication, dashboard, and agent management, creating new components for Qwen and LiveKit configuration. The immediate focus before this summary was frontend development, specifically updating agent detail pages and preparing for a visual workflow builder.

<product_requirements>
The AFO platform is a multi-tenant SaaS designed for B2B sales/service teams, enabling AI agents for customer engagement via voice/text, automating lead qualification, scheduling, and support. Key features include multimodal communication (text/voice, now via LiveKit and Qwen 3 Omni), Agent Persona Configuration (name, persona, instructions, etc.), RAG-powered Knowledge Base (Milvus), Workflow Execution (external APIs), and various Deployment Options. Users can configure agents, manage knowledge bases, connect third-party APIs (Twilio, CRM, Calendar), and generate deployment code. The platform features a dashboard for live status, analytics, conversation history, and no-code workflow customization. An admin panel provides tiered access, real-time monitoring (WebSockets), and anomaly detection. The core user journey involves agents handling lead qualification and scheduling through RAG and calendar integrations.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has recently completed a significant refactoring and feature addition focused on replacing third-party voice and STT/TTS services with open-source alternatives, followed by frontend UI development.

Specifically:
1.  **LiveKit Migration**: Successfully migrated from Daily.co to LiveKit for WebRTC functionality. This involved updating , creating , updating  with LiveKit dependencies, and modifying  to use . The backend restart after this change was successful.
2.  **Qwen 3 Omni Integration**: Integrated Qwen 3 Omni for multimodal AI. This included creating  and  for backend services and API endpoints.  was updated, and  was modified to include Qwen dependencies. A PyTorch installation issue was resolved, and backend Qwen endpoints were verified ( returned ).
3.  **Frontend Development (Sequential Plan)**:
    *   **Landing Page**: Updated , , and . New components  and  were created.
    *   **Authentication & Dashboard**: The existing  was noted. A new  was created. The frontend  was updated with Qwen session methods, and  was updated with the dashboard route.
    *   **Agent Management**:  was reviewed, and a new  was created for Qwen 3 Omni configuration. A  component and its corresponding route were added.
    *   **Agent Detail Page**:  was reviewed, and  was created.

The system is in a state where the backend services for LiveKit and Qwen 3 Omni are integrated and partially tested, and significant progress has been made on the core frontend components following a sequential development plan. The next explicit step is to build the Visual Workflow Builder.
