The AI engineer successfully progressed the AFO platform by first enhancing the backend workflow service with new node types and integration awareness, ensuring , , and  functionality. A key challenge was a routing issue in FastAPI, which was resolved by reordering routes. The frontend then underwent a significant migration from a Wasp-based architecture to a standard  setup, necessitating extensive file creation, dependency management, and refactoring to replace Wasp-specific imports with  (e.g.,  to ). Multiple frontend bugs, including  and  errors, were systematically fixed. Post-migration, the engineer validated core frontend pages (, , , ) and addressed specific user feedback regarding the  Start Free Trial button and the addition of a . Finally, the engineer began updating documentation and removing  mentions from public-facing sections.

<product_requirements>
The AFO platform is a multi-tenant SaaS for B2B sales/service teams, focusing on AI agents for customer engagement (voice/text) to automate lead qualification, scheduling, and support. It features multimodal communication via LiveKit and Qwen 3 Omni, Agent Persona Configuration, a RAG-powered Knowledge Base (Milvus), Workflow Execution (external APIs), and various Deployment Options. Users can configure agents, manage knowledge, connect third-party APIs (Twilio, CRM, Calendar, Google Drive, Meet, MS Teams, Zoom, VoIP), and generate deployment code. The platform includes a dashboard for live status and analytics, conversation history, and no-code workflow customization. An admin panel supports tiered access, real-time monitoring, and anomaly detection. The current implementation includes a functional Visual Workflow Builder with 11 node types, integration-aware palettes, and validation. The Agent Creation UI is an enhanced 4-step wizard supporting Qwen 3 Omni + LiveKit and 17 integration options. A basic Agent Management Dashboard and detailed Agent Detail Page are also in place.
