## üíª Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python (Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting

- Maximum line length: 100 characters

```bash
# Format code with Black
black backend/

# Check with flake8
flake8 backend/ --max-line-length=100
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend)

- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Use TypeScript for new components
- Functional components with hooks over class components

```bash
# Format code
npm run format
# or
yarn format

# Lint code
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```
