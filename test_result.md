# AFO Platform Testing Results

## Original User Problem Statement
Build Phase 2 features for the Agentic Funnel Orchestration (AFO) platform, including:
- Voice + Workflows integration with Deepgram and Pipecat
- Frontend components for voice interface and workflow management
- Integration of calendar services (Google Calendar, Calendly)
- Webhook/CRM integration endpoints

## Testing Protocol
### Backend Testing
- Test Phase 2 API endpoints (voice sessions, workflows, calendar, webhooks)
- Verify proper error handling and response formats
- Test with valid and invalid inputs

### Frontend Testing
- Test new Phase 2 frontend components
- Verify API client integration
- Test navigation and user flows

## Phase 2 Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes
1. **API Endpoints Added:**
   - `/api/phase2/voice/session` - Voice session management
   - `/api/workflows/` - Workflow CRUD operations
   - `/api/phase2/calendar/*` - Google Calendar and Calendly integration
   - `/api/phase2/webhook/*` - Webhook and CRM integration
   - `/api/voice/tts` - Text-to-Speech with ElevenLabs

2. **Services Created:**
   - `voice_session_service.py` - Voice session management
   - `workflow_service.py` - Workflow orchestration
   - `calendar_service.py` - Calendar integrations
   - `webhook_service.py` - Webhook handling
   - `elevenlabs_service.py` - TTS integration

3. **Backend Structure:**
   - Moved from `/app/agent-service` to `/app/backend` for supervisor compatibility
   - Created `server.py` entry point for uvicorn
   - Updated all imports and configurations

### Frontend Changes
1. **API Client Updates:**
   - Added all Phase 2 API methods to `api-client.ts`
   - Implemented workflow, voice session, calendar, and webhook API calls

2. **New Components:**
   - `VoiceInterface.tsx` - Real-time voice conversation UI (updated to use real API)
   - `VoiceConfigPage.tsx` - Voice configuration and API key management
   - `WorkflowBuilderPage.tsx` - Workflow management (updated to use real API)

3. **Route Updates:**
   - Added `/workflows/:agentId` route
   - Added `/voice/config/:agentId` route
   - Updated `AgentDetailPage` with links to Phase 2 features

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend service running successfully on port 8001
- ✅ Health check endpoint responding correctly
- ⏳ Frontend not yet started (requires Wasp setup)
- ⏳ Backend endpoints need testing
- ⏳ Frontend integration needs testing

## Testing Required
1. Backend endpoint testing for Phase 2 features
2. Frontend component testing
3. End-to-end integration testing

## Notes
- The project uses Wasp framework for frontend, which requires special handling
- Backend uses multi-tenant "bring your own API keys" model for Deepgram, ElevenLabs
- All Phase 2 features follow RESTful API design patterns
